Western ala kadar je. (Biasa mamak western ke laut sikit)\n\nService is not very good. I understand there is too many people but please aware of your customer. Like kene sidai dekat 40 mnit dah. There is one incident the boss take my order and deliver thats is not my order. The blame me for the mistake he made. I always come here just ordering one menu only. Bihun goreng tomyam is a must try.\n\nAtmosphere is ok. I came because of the air cond. inside very loud if too many customer",
