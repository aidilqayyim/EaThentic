    "snippet": "Ordered my food a simple meal 1 colonel burger and large cheezy wedges, ordered at 1:57PM, Time almost 2:46PM i went to the counter seeing everyone receive their orders faster than mine even new customer got their order except for me, asked the staff they realized their mistake and brought my order that was already done. Wow. Honestly the staff was nice but still showed no disregard for my inconvenience, apologized just for the sake of it, some workers was just loitering around. Genuine review, i am just like everyone else who wants to eat, i pay for my food and expect it to come. Simple.",

    "snippet": "On a Sunday evening, you would expect this prime location to be crowded. It wasn't. My family almost had an entire corner of the outlet to ourselves.\nThis corner overlooked the Miri-Pujut highway, with decor reminiscent of a ranch house - a quiet cosy corner to chew on succulent chicken. Quiet because of the deafening blasts of rockets and missiles raining down on Lebanon, Israel, Yemen and Gaza.\nIt's strange how the geopolitics of a region thousands of kilometres away could shorten queues here.\nWe ruminated over this anomaly because the chicken we were served tasted above average - probably because our digestive juices were in overdrive after a long day...",

I grabbed it without a choice as I have been queuing for a long time and didn‚Äôt want to waste my parking ticket and return to my car with nothing. Definitely the worse quality of burger! Waste of time and money at this point. How do you even call yourself a Franchise? I should have walked to Sugarbun or MCD and been less disappointed!",

Service was slow overall, and the tables weren't cleaned properly. Despite ordering and paying first, I had to wait nearly 40 minutes for my food. The experience was a waste of time and the service was disappointing.",

I asked if they had any Zinger burger and he rudely said \"did i mention any zinger just now? No right?\". Just wow. I told him I was just asking, it was a mere question. It required a simple yes or no on his part, easier than saying a whole sarcastic sentence. Another cashier just had to be rude to the customer next to me. The customer was trying to make a payment and the cashier went \"just scan there, it isnt hard\" to which the customer's partner told her off - that she could be corteous and be a little less rude. She just kept quiet but went on to a rant with the cashier attending after the other customer left. \"asking people to be corteous, when u cant even understand something simple\". WORST.",
