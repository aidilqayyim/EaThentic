    "snippet": "I definitely will come again to this place all the food that we eat is delicious.\n\nWe ordered combo A which has a fried chicken which you can choose either original or spicy flavours. It also came with two pcs tender and chicken wings and drummet. For chicken wings and drummet you can choose from 4 flavours. We chose soy garlic and spicy chilli. Both remind me of another brand taste but here the price is pocket friendly.\n\nNot to forget, the combo comes with coleslaw and mashed potato. If you're a fan of mashed potato with still hv a bit of potato chunks you'll definitely love the mashed. The gravy is not too thick and it combined well . While for the coleslaw, i love the tangy taste.\n\nMas for the croissant its safe, buttery and definitely delicious.it comes with a hot dark chocolate it taste so good, it blends well with the buttery taste of the croissant, the sourness from the berries, the bitterness from the hot dark choco and the sweetness from the icing sugar . Its like a party in my mouth.\n\nIll definitely come again and of course with a different squad. All in all, its worth every penny",

    "snippet": "Saw this restaurant always empty, so we decided to give it a try. While at the cashier counter, we noticed every employee working in the kitchen without face masks and chatting away. Suddenly, an employee sneezed, not realizing we were there. Another staff member noticed and approached him,he said it's okay, no problem.\n\nWe wanted to cancel, but since their chicken was ready and displayed in the warmer, we decided to proceed.\n\nPlease ask your employees (especially those working in the kitchen) to wear masks while working. It's an open kitchen, customers can see and hear you all.\n\nWe were very surprised that everything was chuck inside the box with the food. The chili packet and plastic teaspoon might be dirty, yet they were sitting on my chicken.\n\nTastewise, they were okay, better than any pasar malam seller. But the crispy part broke into pieces. The chicken was not even warm and dry inside.\n\nThe mashed potato was not fully mashed,you still get a bunch of powder.\n\nI didn't have the appetite to try the coleslaw, hence I can't comment.\n\nAfter speaking with a few people, we seem to have had the same experience as well.\n\nPlease do more R&D if you wish to stay in SP longer.",

Which is reasonable i guess, no complain coz get hot chicken. Since the Ayam will be fried upon request or order from Customers, so I specifically asked for Rib & Breast part which the Staffs said OK...i repeated this like 3x coz said please help to make sure & check so that the part of the Chicken is correct...the Staff did tell another staff regarding this request, after waiting for the Chicken to be fried & ready, maybe about 20-30mins, guess what got entirely not the part of chicken i requested...Waste the Customer's Time to wait & clearly mentioned many many times on the request, yet the staff not bother to Listen & Comply, just random fry & give what he wants...When confronted, the staff buat muka tak tau like could not give a damn about it yet No Apology from that staff, just sit in the kitchen like he is Right...the other 2 staffs were OK & apologize for it but apology doesn't change the Wasted Time or the Requested Chicken...just to add, the Chicken is really Not Nice in my opinion coz doesn't taste anything great at all, just normal Fried Chicken...i can get better tasting Chicken for RM3, here already Expensive yet Not Nice...Pasar mlm taste better for RM1.\n\nAlso the Cleanliness of the place is OUT...i saw 2 Cockroach at the pastry place...Seriously???..u give Customer to Eat this kind of Contaminated Food while charging a premium to the Customers?\n\nSometimes i feel is Pointless to help local businesses when they not interested to serve Customers properly...i give chance & want to encourage Local Businesses, i spend alot of money to this Shop as well but to get Unsatisfactory Service, things not ready, need to wait forever & ultimately Pest Invested Shop, just indicate how Dirty the place is...i urge the Owner to take these feedback Seriously before Customers get ill or the Shop Close Down, u the Owner, u are Responsible on Training the Staffs, do regular Checks, make sure Clean Hygiene Food & Premise, etc.",

Unfortunately, the staff were unfriendly and seemed uninterested in helping customers. I went there just me and my 1 year old baby, I asked the staff for a baby chair, and they just pointed me to grab one from the sink area — seriously? That time  there is no queue of customers.Even worse, I noticed that the kitchen staff were not wearing masks or gloves.\n\nThe fried chicken was bland and lacked the of seasoning. The sauce was overly salty and not spicy at all — a real disappointment if you’re expecting flavor.\n\nThe only thing that stood out in a positive way was the mashed potato, which was creamy and well-seasoned. Hope they can improve the service, and more importantly, the taste and quality of the chicken.",
