You will see many cycles 'parked' at the rear and sweaty customers like our party of 3 on this occassion, taking refuge from the blistering heat. As it was about high noon, we decided to lunch here. It was busy with customers, but staff were professional, polite ans curteous. Walking distance to Monumen Alaf Baru and Jambatan Seri Wawasan. The night views here of both must be amazing. The ayam goreng meal with curry water and nasi lemak rice was amazing. Some kangkung thrown in would have been better. Nuggets came with seasonal 'Nether' sauce - hot and sourish - very tantalising.",

    "snippet": "We were craving a sundae after a long break from McDonald’s and decided to make it a cheat day for Raya. We ordered burgers, which were fine, but the sundae was a disappointment. It seemed like they had pre-refrigerated it and just handed it over when ordered. The ice cream melted too fast and was lumpy, while the chocolate syrup was practically frozen. On top of that, the portion wasn’t as full as usual. We regretted ordering it… might as well have stuck to our efforts to avoid McDonald’s as much as we could.\n\nWe only went there because no other restaurants were open at that time due to Raya, and this was what we got - so frustrating. Of course, we could have complained and probably gotten a fresher one, but we were exhausted, not in the mood to complain (in Raya mood) and the queue was long. Maybe they were short-staffed and had to find ways to manage, but honestly, I’d rather them not selling poorly stored ice cream than ruin someone’s cravings. And let’s be real, everyone knows that refrigerated fries and ice cream from McDonald’s are just bad.",

Then, all the ordering kiosks were offline, so I had to order at the counter. The issue is, i was standing there almost 10 min but none of your staff came to attend,even though several of them were walking past n clearly saw me. Only after being reminded did someone come over, and even then the staff’s attitude was unfriendly.\nTo make things worse, i really wang to order fried chicken but the fried chicken was all sold out, so I had to order a burger instead. But when the burger arrived, it was cold and not fresh at all. Honestly, the service and quality at this branch were extremely disappointing and far below expectations , and this is not the first time I’ve experienced such poor service at this outlet.. I really hope management will take this feedback seriously and improve the service, because this was one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had at McDonald’s.",
